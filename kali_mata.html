  <h1>Kali Mata Sprituality</h1>
  <p>Yantra helps to gain Consciousness <br> Consciousness is the Core of Kali Sprituality</p>
  <img src="pics/yantra.png" alt="">

  <h2>Why God is called as Sat-Chit-Ananda </h2>
  <p><br> God has all Attribute. <br> Sat is the Eternal. That never Ends . It is Truth and It is accepted everywhere
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Chit is related to Consciousness. Consciousness is the asking QUestion to SELF , Who am I , Why am I here. Whats my
    purose ? <br> All the answers are answered from SELF within in Consciousness </p>
  <br>
  <p>Annand is the blissfullness or Happiness. You have your Happiness Inside , You just have to Explore your Happiness
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>Thus the person has everything inside, Truth, Consciouss and Happy. <br> we are an entity individual of God </p>
  <br>Similarly , Lines has been said by OSHO also You all are Buddha.. You just have to explore it

  <p>I help everyone to train and go through Goddess Kali Yantra Sprituality </p>

  <h2>Sprituality Consciousness can never be Attained by Machine, <i>this is where Education should be focussed</i></h2>

  <br>
  <h2>What difference between Sprituality & Religion ?</h2>
  <p>Sprituality is related to Consciousness <i>Religion is related to Task and Activities. Religion is Byproduct of
      Sprituality</i></p>
  <p>Once you know Sprituality, you know the Truth of Being. </p>
  <p>Religion is realted to daily task , ritual process activitiy. Religion only can never takes to the Consciousness
    level</p>
  <p>To be Spritual, you know to read several articles, You can attain Consciousness only through Sprituality. </p>

  <h2> Why God kali is Special God among so others ?</h2>
  <p>Kali accepts all things. Kali Gives freedom. Kali take away your FEAR. Fear is the biggest problem in Human Minds.
  </p>
  <p>Kali is Powerful, Kali is energetic. Kali is Scientific. Kali is Sprituality Consciousness with BINDU at the Center
    of YANTRA. </p>
